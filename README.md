# Advent of Code 2021 in Rust and TDD
I am trying to use Rust programming language and TDD to solve the <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021">Advent of Code 2021</a>.
This repository is a Rust workspace, and each day's solution is a project under the workspace.

The idea is to solve the problems and continue to refactor codes. I am not using "advanced" features of Rust, and I am not importing a lot of crates. So probably I am "reinventing the wheels" unnecessarily sometimes.
As I gain more knowledge in Rust, I think I will continue to optimize the solutions.
